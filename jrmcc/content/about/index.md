Hiya! My name is Jeff Minard and I have been developing web sites since 1996 when I started a little journal site via my web hosting job. Since then things sure have changed a lot ;-)

My career and original love started with PHP and MySQL, but programming is more about understanding the logic of process than the specific language you create it with. I dabble in NodeJS, Ruby, Python, and even a little bit of C these days.

I also enjoy building and riding PEV's: Personal Electric Vehicles. Bikes, skateboards, onewheels, unicycles -- let me slap a motor on it and I'm in.

\- Jeff Minard
