The torque arm arrived from send-cut-send and was looked great. I modeled up a jig and drilled some holes in the sides, then went to tap them for the m3 bolts. _And broke off a bit inside the hole._ Sadly, no amount of drilling or other finagling would get it out.

Plan B -- send off the fully modeled design to [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) and had it properly machined out of stainless steel. Drilled and tapped by them as well. Cost was ~$75 and submit->doorway time was about 3 weeks (Jul 22nd to Aug 11th). Part came well wrapped and in perfectly milled, drilled, and tapped condition. Installed perfectly on the bike.

I rewired my motor to use a HiGo L1019 connector so it will handle more current and also added a temperature probe inside the motor.

All-in-all it's working great. I'm pushing 3,000 watts of power down the line without issue and have regen turned up pretty high (about 30-40A, if I recall). I may up that a little bit, though, as it's not _quite_ giving me the stopping power I'm after. Temps inside the motor have never gone over 55C -- so downright frigid as far as ebike motors go.

And the overall current state of the bike is looking like this:

Ultimately, I'm really glad to be back on a direct drive. I keep dabbling with geared motors, and while the torque advantage they offer is unmatched, the perks of regen braking and sublime joy of **silently** cruising down the road just keep me coming back to direct drive every time.

At this point I mostly consider this bike complete -- there's some room for a brake upgrade in the future, but there's no rush to do that with the regen being added back into the system.

Have fun!
