    I'd like to point out that this desk is <em>still</em> my daily work horse.
    It has traveled around the globe with me (2.5 year stint in Sweden) and
    survived at least 5 separate moves outside of that. The surface is still in
    exceptional shape for a 9 year old desk and it's holding up great. I've only
    recently noticed that the screws are starting to have worn-down threads.
    I'm loathe to think that I might have to find a replacement for this modern
    marvel should these screws ever actually fail me.

    All in all, this is the best desk I've ever owned, and if you can ever find
    one on craiglist, buy it. This desk is so good it falls under the same
    lamentable category of "Why did they cancel FireFly?!"
