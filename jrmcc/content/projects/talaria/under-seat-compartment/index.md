It's not my bike until something is 3d printed on it ;D

I want to store some extra electronics on the bike, out of the way. I notice there's a nice little gap under the seat, so I made up a covering box which creates a small pocket down there. You do have to disassemble the whole dang seat, but you'll also finally get those last bits of shipping plastic out!

I even went so far as to figure out the angle of the nuts so that this printed piece is angled correctly. (The metal plate, fun note, is not -- the stock screws are engaged off plane and just dig into an edge.)

When installed, the box is nearly invisible:

And, even when you find it, it looks like it belongs, plus there's no visible wires (they're all hidden under the key/button plate).

## Helpful wiring notes

If you trace the start button to its connector, there are a few useful wires here. You'll find a ground, battery voltage while the bike is off and a wire for battery voltage when the bike is on.

There is also a wire which goes to the rear light which carries 12v when the bike is on. I don't have any info on how much draw these leads can handle.

# Make your own!

Here are the Fusion360 file and a STEP file if you wish to print your own. I printed in PETG-CF for outdoor use and gave it heavier walls and infill for strength, especially around the bolts. Print it the compartment area facing up, the bolt overhangs don't need support.
